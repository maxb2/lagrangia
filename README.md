## Idea

An agentic AI for performing astronomy tasks.

Use an MCP server that provides:
1. Weather Data.
   1. Standard
   2. Astronomically relevant weather (seeing, etc.)
   3. Space weather
   4. Bortle levels
2. When and where objects are visible in the sky for a given location. Could be almanac quality data or better.
3. Space news.
4. More?
